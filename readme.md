# Project 2 Code Review

We will be doing a code review on each others projects! We'll be breaking up into groups of 2.

# Objective
- This is not a time in which to implement new features.
- This is a time to refactor
- Imagine trying to get this code presentable to an employer.
- Focus on code quality/maintainability - Things you could look for:
  - Code Indentation
  - look for places where you could utilize associations instead of complex AR queries
  - remove code duplication(extract methods if you can)
  - abstract program functionality into methods for clarity
  - ensure CSS selectors are over arching concepts instead of specific elements
  - remove logic from views to controller or model
    - database queries belongs in controller
    - business logic belongs in model

## First 25 minutes
1. Pick someone to be the driver. The other person in the pair will navigate.
2. That driver will fork their partner's project.
3. Together you will refactor to make the code base better.

## Second 25 minutes
1. Swap driver and navigator.
2. Continue to refactor original person's code.
3. Submit a pull request to person's code.

## Break 10 minutes

## Third 25 minutes
1. The current driver will now fork the navigator's code .
2. Follow the same process.

## Last 25 minutes
1. Swap driver and navigator.
2. Follow the same process.
