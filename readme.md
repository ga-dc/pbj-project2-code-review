# Project 2 Code Review

For this exercise, we'll be forming pairs, and reviewing each other on each
others projects!

The goal is to take some time to improve your code, with the help of a dedicated
second pair of eyes. Each team member will get ~50 minutes of help improving
their code.

**Note**: you should **not** be implementing any new functionality during this
exercise, only **refactoring existing code / features.**

## Before You Begin
Push the latest copy of your project to GitHub, so we can give you the most
accurate feedback possible.

## Objective
- Imagine trying to get this code presentable to an employer.
- Focus on code quality/maintainability - Things you could look for:
  - Code Indentation
  - look for places where you could utilize associations instead of complex AR queries
  - remove code duplication(extract methods if you can)
  - abstract program functionality into methods for clarity
  - ensure CSS selectors are over arching concepts instead of specific elements
  - remove logic from views to controller or model
    - database queries belongs in controller
    - business logic belongs in model

## Schedule

### 1:45 - 2:00: Framing today and next week

### 2:00 - 2:15: Retro with your instructor

### 2:15 - 2:40: Begin pairing

1. Pick someone to be the driver. The other person in the pair will navigate.
2. That driver will fork/clone their partner's project.
3. Start refactoring!

### 2:40 - 3:05: Swap drivers

1. Swap driver and navigator.
2. Continue refactoring the same code!
3. Wrap up by submitting a pull request.

### 3:05 - 3:15: Break

### 3:15 - 3:40: Switch codebases

1. Now switch to the **other person's codebase**. Fork/clone the project.
2. The driver should be the person who didn't write the code.
3. Start refactoring!

### 3:40 - 4:05: Swap drivers

1. Swap driver and navigator.
2. Continue refactoring!
3. Wrap up by submitting a pull request.

### 3:50 - 4:00: Break
